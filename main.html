                <p>I am a self-motivated student studying Computer Science at California State University, Fresno. With experience in several IT departments I have
                    worked with my team, collaborated with other departmens, and managed small groups to execute important jobs that needed to be done. I am able to use
                    this experience in other work settings in the software development world and am eager to learn more one problem at a time.

                <h3>CSci 115: Data Structures in System Design.</h3>
                <p><strong>Shortest Path Game:</strong> Developed a project in C++ that created characters with different attributes that need to traverse a dynamic map.
                 In this project I implemented custom characters, dynamic terrain generation, and shortest path algorithm for characters based
                  the terrain they were traversing.</p>
                 <h3>CSci 144: Operating Systems</h3>
                <p> <strong>One-Way Tunnel Simulator:</strong> Developed a single lane tunnel using C++ mult-threading to simulate cars passing one each side based on if the light at the end of
                the tunnel is red or green. The project is complently dynamic based on two inputs, the total amount of cars passing on both sides
              and the max number of cars that could pass through the tunnel at their given turn.</p>
                <h3>CSci 150: Software Engineering.</h3>
