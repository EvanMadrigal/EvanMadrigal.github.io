                <p>I am a self-motivated Software Engineer who's studied Computer Science at California State University, Fresno. With experience in several technology related departments I have
                    worked with my team, collaborated with other departmens, and managed small groups to execute important jobs that needed to be done. I am able to use
                    this experience in other work settings in the software development world and am eager to learn more one problem at a time.
